# Peace
A menulet that plays a blank sound on repeat for OSX. A nearly useless app!

The issue: I connected my iMac's headphone jack to a line-in on my PC. After about 15 seconds of no audio, I get a
humming sound. I found an old apple forum post to go to /Applications/Utilities/Audio Midi Setup to use 96000Hz and 24 bit 
Integer which helped a bit by reducing the hum by 50%.

How to use: Run the menulet, right click the peace sign in the menu tray and click start.
